SMNC coin tools

For the record, I suck at Markdown.

Firstly, see the LICENSE file for the license (hint; GPL-something)

Secondly, I created this script to make it easy to export SMNC (Simple MasterNode Coin) data from their explorer API.
As for liability, just check the export.php script!


#Requirements
IMPORTANT: This script has been tested on a Linux system, it's been written with keeping other systems in mind but I can't check since I only run Linux.

This script has also been written to not require additional PHP libraries (like cURL).
It does require PHP (duh) so be sure to have that installed. Not sure about the version(s) but I wrote it with PHP 7.x experience so go figure...


Will add an SMNC donation address and others so people can donate if wanted! (very much appreciated!)
Also, a star here and there would be awesome :)

#Running the script

Export.php:
In a terminal or CMD or whatever; 'php export.php' - and see the parameters.
